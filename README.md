# Etch a Sketch
The game from my early years!
I wanted to try something different, and also to deepen my knowledge about DOM manipulation with JavaScript.

**Live version** of the game is [here](https://dariuszgros.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)

Select a color to start the game. To toggle drawing, click on any cell. Pressing reset or resizing the grid will clear the window.
**Have fun!**

## Things I learned during this project
* DOM manipulation using JavaScript;
* Creating HTML elements and referencing them with JavaScript;
* Enjoy programming more and more!
